Project 1

Welcome to Whats for Dinner! By Kyle Cooper, Kobe Matias, and Erica Cannedy.
Our application is designed to help you decide what to have for dinner while also pairing a drink recommendation. 

On loading the page, four choices to choose your protein are available. 

Please pick your protein: Beef, Chicken, Pork, Seafood.

According to your protein choice, the application will display four meals that contain your main protein choice. 
When the user clicks on a protein choice a modal will populate with the image of the selected meal, the ingredients needed to recreate the meal and the instructions/ recipe for the meal.  

At the bottom of the page, 3 drink recommendations that pair well with displayed meals will appear. 
When the user selects on a drink, a modal will populate with the image of the selected drink, the ingredients needed to recreate the drink and the instructions for creating the drink. 

If you do not like the recommendations provided for you, you can reload both the meal and drinks seperately by clicking the blue reload buttons underneath the meal and drink titles.  

A navbar was also created to easily change one's protein choice after selecting off of the landing page. The navbar also links to the About page which shows the app developers and their role in the project. 

For this project, we used TheCocktailDB.com and TheMealDB.com API's.
